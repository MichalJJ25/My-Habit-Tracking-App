## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `sqlite3` (usually included in Python 3.x-versions)

### Steps

Either put all the files into a new project, using a python-specific integrated development environment like e.g. "PyCharm", or

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/MichalJJ25/My-Habit-Tracking-App]
   cd My-Habit-Tracking-App
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This project only uses Python's standard library, so no additional installations should be required.

---

## Database Setup
The app uses an SQLite database to store habits and completions. 
The database is automatically created when you run the app for the first time.

- **Database File**: `habits.db` (created in the project directory).
- **Tables**:
  - `habits`: Stores habit details (name, frequency and start date).
  - `completions`: Stores completions (as a number) and completion dates for each habit.

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd My-Habit-Tracking-App
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

Then follow the CLI menu to:
   - Add habits.
